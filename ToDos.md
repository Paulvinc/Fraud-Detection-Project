ToDo List
- EDA
    - look at high correlation
    - reduce features (identify important ones)
    - maybe rename columns
    - deal with skewed data 
    - create a useful datetime variable
- Preprocessing
    - One Hot Encoding = change datatype (where required)
    - Scaling
- Model
    - Ensamble (3 different models)
    - XGBoost
    - KNN
    - LogReg
    - Naive Bayes (as base?)
- Visualizations (Plots)
- Presentation
