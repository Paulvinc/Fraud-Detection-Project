This is a machine learning project of being able to predict whether a transaction is a fraud or not.
The Dataset is taken from a closed [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/xente-fraud-detection-challenge) competition.

Fraud detection is an important application of machine learning in the financial services sector. This solution will help Xente provide improved and safer service to its customers.

This competition is sponsored by Xente, Innovation Village, and insight2impact.

## **My tasks in this notebook**

**Understanding fraudulent transactions!**
  * Do fraudulent transactions have a common pattern?
  * How do they differ from "normal" transactions?
  * What features are important to recognize fraudulent transactions?

**Error metric**
  * The error metric for this competition is the F1 score, which ranges from 0 (total failure) to 1 (perfect score). Hence, the closer your score is to 1, the better your model.

  * F1 Score: A performance score that combines both precision and recall. It is a harmonic mean of these two variables. Formula is given as: 2PrecisionRecall/(Precision + Recall)
